I will also recommend and make specialized remedies specific to your needs and situation. I am certified in PSYCH-K<sup>&reg;</sup> and this will be the majority of your session, I will also use and teach other energy work so that you can continue your progress in between sessions. 
							p.content PSYCH-K<sup>&reg;</sup> is a unique and direct way to change subconscious beliefs that perpetuate old habits of thinking and behaving that you would like to change. It is a simple process that helps you communicate with your subconscious mind so you can change beliefs that limit your self-esteem, relationships, job performance, and even your physical health.

							p.content "Healing from invisible diseases is multi faceted, I am extremely grateful for Brittany and Psych-K. Without the release of stored emotions I believe that it is almost impossible to heal completely. Thank you for being a bright light and angel in my life, I canâ€™t recommend Psyck-K enough."
							p.content.subtext - Melissa W. Missouri, USA
							p.content "Psych k with Brittany helped me amazingly to remember who I am and to feel in touch with myself again. I felt like I woke from a deep sleep and remembered who I am, what my purpose is, and what I truly want to achieve." 
							p.content.subtext -Miles Vracko, Switzerland 
							p.content "Psych-K is something I was slightly skeptical of at first. After looking into it more, I began to see how this form of energy work works, and thought I should give it a try. After being sexually abused as a child and later raped and also in an abusive relationship for many years, I was not emotionally ok and am still on a journey of healing. I wasn't someone who is very confident. When we began, confidence is what I chose to work on. A few days after Psyck-K with Brittany, I felt more awake, stood taller and was smiling and looking people in the eyes. Friends said I seemed different, and I do feel different. I felt lifted for sure! I highly recommend Pysch-K to anyone!"
